                    Everyone's been posting their 2025 recap, and while that will be coming in a bit, I want, first, to focus on the lessons I've learned over the course of the year.
                    This year was quite a blast, and I did more things than I'd ever done before it. Some went well, some didn't, but I learnt lessons from every single one.
                    Here's a list of them:
                </p>
				
				<h3>Taking pictures</h2>
				<p>
                    This might seem mundane as a first lesson, but it’s real. I never cared much for taking pictures, sometimes even taking pride in it as me being “unique” 🤡. 
                    Over the year, I learned that was folly when I started forgetting events I’d been part of just months earlier. What will now happen in a few years? 💀
                    Now, I make it a duty to take at least 3 pictures at every key moment: meeting someone, going somewhere, or finding something interesting. 
                    Thanks also to some of my friends for convincing me to make this change 😂.
                </p>

				<h3>‘As early as possible’ vs ‘As quickly as possible’</h2>
				<p>Continue with more content. You can use <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, and <a href="#">links</a> as needed.</p>
